  abstract = {Fragmentation of meter-sized impactors in the Martian atmosphere leads to the formation of crater clusters consisting of up to hundreds of craters spread over an area of up to kilometers across. Identification of 77 crater clusters on the Martian surface reveals that as the size of the cluster increases the range in the number of craters present increases. Furthermore, clus- ters with larger craters typically consist of a single or several large craters among numerous smaller craters, whereas clusters of smaller craters show a broad variation in the size-frequency distribution of craters. To further understanding of meteoroid fragmentation and the forma- tion of crater clusters on Mars, a meteoroid atmospheric entry model proposed by Wheeler et al. (2018), which assumes an initial meteoroid with a non-uniform structure was adapted and implemented in Python. A Monte Carlo simulation was performed using this new model to produce synthetic cluster data for comparison with observations on Mars. For comparison, the same Monte Carlo approach was performed using two previous atmospheric entry models, that assume the meteoroid has a uniform initial structure. The new model developed in this work is able to replicate the variation in size-frequency distribution of craters seen on Mars; whereas, the clusters produced by previous models do not display any variation in crater size-frequency distribution observed as the size of clusters increase. e results of this work indicate that the tra- ditional method of modelling meteoroid fragmentation, that produces a collection of fragments all of similar size, is not appropriate for fragmentation and crater cluster formation on Mars. Instead replicating crater cluster formation on Mars requires a steep size-frequency distribution of fragments with multiple small fragments and fewer large fragments.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the physics of meteoroid breakup in the atmosphere and its implications for the observed features of strewn fields. There are several effects which cause dispersion of the meteoroid fragments: gravity, differential lift of the fragments, bow shock interaction just after breakup, centripetal separation by a rotating meteoroid, and possibly a dynamical transverse separation resulting from the crushing deceleration in the atmosphere. Of these, we show that gravity alone can produce the common pattern in which the largest crater occurs at the downrange end of the scatter ellipse. The average lift-to-drag ratio of the tumbling fragments must be less than about 10−3, otherwise small fragments would produce small craters downrange of the main crater, and this is not generally observed. The cross-range dispersion is probably due to the combined effects of bow shock interaction, crushing deceleration, and possibly spinning of the meteoroid. A number of terrestrial strewn fields are discussed in the light of these ideas, which are formulated quantitatively for a range of meteoroid velocities, entry angles, and crushing strengths. It is found that when the crater size exceeds about 1 km, the separation between the fragments upon landing is a fraction of their own diameter, so that the crater formed by such a fragmented meteoroid is almost indistinguishable from that formed by a solid body of the same total mass and velocity.},

  abstract = {Abstract Asteroids and comets 10–100 m in size that collide with Earth disrupt dramatically in the atmosphere with an explosive transfer of energy, caused by extreme air drag. Such airbursts produce a strong blastwave that radiates from the meteoroid's trajectory and can cause damage on the surface. An established technique for predicting airburst blastwave damage is to treat the airburst as a static source of energy and to extrapolate empirical results of nuclear explosion tests using an energy-based scaling approach. Here we compare this approach to two more complex models using the iSALE shock physics code. We consider a moving-source airburst model where the meteoroid's energy is partitioned as two-thirds internal energy and one-third kinetic energy at the burst altitude, and a model in which energy is deposited into the atmosphere along the meteoroid's trajectory based on the pancake model of meteoroid disruption. To justify use of the pancake model, we show that it provides a good fit to the inferred energy release of the 2013 Chelyabinsk fireball. Predicted overpressures from all three models are broadly consistent at radial distances from ground zero that exceed three times the burst height. At smaller radial distances, the moving-source model predicts overpressures two times greater than the static-source model, whereas the cylindrical line-source model based on the pancake model predicts overpressures two times lower than the static-source model. Given other uncertainties associated with airblast damage predictions, the static-source approach provides an adequate approximation of the azimuthally averaged airblast for probabilistic hazard assessment.},

  abstract = {Abstract— We investigate the action of the martian atmosphere on entering meteoroids for present and past atmospheres with various surface pressures to predict the smallest observable craters, and to understand the implications for the size distributions of craters on Mars and meteoroids in space. We assume different strengths appropriate to icy, stone, and iron bodies and test the results against available data on terrestrial bolides. Deceleration, ablation, and fragmentation effects are included. We find that the smallest icy, stone, and iron meteoroids to hit the martian ground at crater forming speeds of ≥500 m/s have diameters of about 2 m, 0.03-0.9 m (depending on strength), and 0.01 m, respectively, in the current atmosphere. For hypothetical denser past atmospheres, the cutoff diameters rise. At a surface pressure of 100 mb, the cutoff diameters are about 24 m, 5–12 m, and 0.14 m for the 3 classes. The weaker stony bodies in the size range of about 1–30 m may explode at altitudes of about 10–20 km above the ground. These figures imply that under the present atmosphere, the smallest craters made by these objects would be as follows: by ice bodies, craters of diameter (D) ˜8 m, by stones about 0.5–6 m, and by irons, about 0.3 m. A strong depletion of craters should, thus, occur at diameters below about 0.3 m to 5 m. Predicted fragmentation and ablation effects on weak meteoroids in the present atmosphere may also produce a milder depletion below D ˜500 m, relative to the lunar population. But, this effect may be difficult to detect in present data because of additional losses of small craters due to sedimentation, dunes, and other obliteration effects. Craters in strewn fields, caused by meteoroid fragmentation, will be near or below present-day resolution limits, but examples have been found. These phenomena have significant consequences. Under the present atmosphere, the smallest (decimeter-scale) craters in sands and soils could be quickly obliterated but might still be preserved on rock surfaces, as noted by Hörz et al. (1999). Ancient crater populations, if preserved, could yield diagnostic signatures of earlier atmospheric conditions. Surfaces formed under past denser atmospheres (few hundred mbar), if preserved by burial and later exposed by exhumation, could show: a) striking depletions of small craters (few meter sizes up to as much as 200 m), relative to modern surfaces; b) more clustered craters due to atmospheric breakup; and c) different distributions of meteorite types, with 4 m to 200 m craters formed primarily by irons instead of by stones as on present-day Mars. Megaregolith gardening of the early crust would be significant but coarser than the gardening of the ancient lunar uplands.},

The motion of these fragments cannot be described in the frame of liquid-like models. The primary purpose of this study is to achieve some success in improving the alternative model of separate fragments, which is based on studying the motion of a finite number of fragments interacting with each other through the air pressure. The three-dimensional (3-D) numerical technique is elaborated for the direct modeling of the flow around several arbitrarily arranged fragments. The model allows us to calculate the ablation mass rate and aerodynamic loading for each fragment. The new approach (hybrid model) based on the simultaneous solution of the 3-D hydrodynamic equations for the airflow and the differential equations for the motion of discrete particles is proposed to study the debris cloud evolution, taking into account successive fragmentation. The simplified version of this model was applied to the Sikhote-Alin meteorite shower, Benešov bolide, and small meteoroids' impacts against the Martian surface.},

We report these statistics for 77 clusters: number of craters, size of cluster, dispersion of cluster, direction (azimuth) from which the impactor approached, and an estimate of the angle from vertical of the impact. Clusters range from a few to hundreds of craters, with most containing tens of craters. They are most commonly dispersed over hundreds of meters, with extents ranging from a few meters to a few kilometers. We find that dispersion generally does not correlate with topographic elevation. However, when the highest elevations are disregarded, clusters are more dispersed at lower elevations, as expected. Impact azimuths are randomly distributed and do not express a clear directionality of incoming meteoroids. Results suggest impacts occur closer to horizontal than expected, which could be due to observational effects. The characteristics we report here provide important constraints for future work in understanding atmospheric fragmentation processes; properties of the impactors themselves, such as density and orbital parameters; and the seismic detectability of impacts. These are critical aspects to understand, as approximately half of current impacts are observed to be clusters.},

Analytic models of asteroid breakup and energy deposition processes are needed in order to assess potential airburst hazards, and to enable inferences about asteroid properties or breakup physics to be made from comparisons with observed meteors. This paper presents a fragment-cloud model (FCM) that is able to represent a broad range of breakup behaviors and the resulting variations in energy deposition in ways that make it a useful tool for both applications. Sensitivity studies are performed to investigate how variations the model's fragmentation parameters affect the energy deposition results for asteroids 20–500m in diameter. The model is also used to match observational data from the Chelyabinsk meteor and infer potential asteroid properties and representative modeling parameter ranges. Results illustrate how the model's fragmentation parameters can introduce different energy deposition features, and how much they affect the overall energy deposition rates, magnitudes, and altitudes that would drive ground damage for risk assessment applications.},

  abstract = {Asteroids populations are highly diverse, ranging from coherent monoliths to loosely bound rubble piles, with a broad range of material and compositional properties. These different structures and properties could significantly affect how an asteroid breaks up and deposits energy in the atmosphere, and how much ground damage may occur from resulting blast waves. We have previously developed a fragment-cloud model (FCM) for assessing the atmospheric breakup and energy deposition of asteroids striking Earth. The approach represents ranges of breakup characteristics by combining progressive fragmentation with releases of variable fractions of debris and larger discrete fragments. In this work, we have extended the FCM to also represent asteroids with varied initial structures, such as rubble piles or fractured bodies. We have used the extended FCM to model the Chelyabinsk, Benešov, Košice, and Tagish Lake meteors, and have obtained excellent matches to energy deposition profiles derived from their light curves. These matches provide validation for the FCM approach, help guide further model refinements, and enable inferences about pre-entry structure and breakup behavior. Results highlight differences in the amount of small debris vs. discrete fragments in matching the various flare characteristics of each meteor. The Chelyabinsk flares were best represented using relatively high debris fractions, while Košice and Benešov cases were more notably driven by their discrete fragmentation characteristics, perhaps indicating more cohesive initial structures. Tagish Lake exhibited a combination of these characteristics, with lower-debris fragmentation at high altitudes followed by sudden disintegration into small debris in the lower flares. Results from all cases also suggest that lower ablation coefficients and debris spread rates may be more appropriate for the way in which debris clouds are represented in FCM, offering an avenue for future model refinement.},

  abstract = {As evidenced by the Chelyabinsk and Tunguska airburst events in Russia, decameter-scale Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) can pose a hazard to human life and infrastructure from the energy they deposit in the atmosphere as they break up. To understand the potential damage these small NEOs can cause on Earth's surface, it is imperative to be able to model their atmospheric entry quickly and accurately. Here we compare three semi-analytical models of asteroid airbursts that differ in their descriptions of fragment separation and spreading. Each model can be calibrated to produce a good fit to the energy deposition curve inferred from Chelyabinsk observations, but in each case the implied initial meteoroid strength is different and when the calibrated models are upscaled to Tunguska, the results diverge. This introduces an inter-model uncertainty that compounds the large range of uncertain physical and model parameters that influence probabilistic hazard assessment. Uncertainty quantification of airburst energy deposition was performed for a theoretical impacting object with H-magnitude 27, assuming no prior knowledge of any other impactor or model parameter. Each of the three models produces a different distribution of airburst outcomes, however, the variation attributable to physical parameter uncertainty is far larger than the inter-model differences. To constrain the initial conditions of the Tunguska event, the same uncertainty quantification was performed for an H-magnitude 24 event. Among the scenarios consistent with Tunguska observations (5–10 km burst altitude, 10–60° trajectory angle, 3–50 MT TNT total energy release) the most likely range of impact conditions was: radius of 25–75 m, mass of 1× 108– 2.5× 109 kg, initial velocity of 11.5–33 km/s, and angle of 25–60°.},

We have also utilized the differential panchromatic luminous efficiency of ReVelle and Ceplecha (2002) to compute bolide luminosity. In addition we also introduce the concept of the differential and integral acoustic/infrasonic efficiency and generalized it to the case of mechanical wave efficiency including internal atmospheric gravity waves generated during entry. Unlike the other efficiencies which are assumed to be a constant multiple of the luminous efficiency, the acoustic efficiency is calculated independently using a ``first principles'' approach. All of these topics have been pursued using either a homogeneous or a porous meteoroid model with great success. As a direct result, porosity seems to be a rather good possibility for explaining anomalous meteoroid behavior in the atmosphere.},

Analytic models of asteroid entry and breakup physics are used to compute the energy deposition, which can then be compared against measured light curves and used to estimate ground damage due to airburst events. This work assesses and compares energy deposition results from four existing approaches to asteroid breakup modeling, and presents a new model that combines key elements of those approaches. The existing approaches considered include a liquid drop or âpancakeâ model where the object is treated as a single deforming body, and a set of discrete fragment models where the object breaks progressively into individual fragments. The new model incorporates both independent fragments and aggregate debris clouds to represent a broader range of fragmentation behaviors and reproduce more detailed light curve features. All five models are used to estimate the energy deposition rate versus altitude for the Chelyabinsk meteor impact, and results are compared with an observationally derived energy deposition curve. Comparisons show that four of the five approaches are able to match the overall observed energy deposition profile, but the features of the combined model are needed to better replicate both the primary and secondary peaks of the Chelyabinsk curve.},

  abstract = {Following the emergence of a novel coronavirus1 (SARS-CoV-2) and its spread outside of China, Europe has experienced large epidemics. In response, many European countries have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions such as closure of schools and national lockdowns. We study the impact of major interventions across 11 European countries for the period from the start of COVID-19 until the 4th of May 2020 when lockdowns started to be lifted. Our model calculates backwards from observed deaths to estimate transmission that occurred several weeks prior, allowing for the time lag between infection and death. We use partial pooling of information between countries with both individual and shared effects on the reproduction number. Pooling allows more information to be used, helps overcome data idiosyncrasies, and enables more timely estimates. Our model relies on fixed estimates of some epidemiological parameters such as the infection fatality rate, does not include importation or subnational variation and assumes that changes in the reproduction number are an immediate response to interventions rather than gradual changes in behavior. Amidst the ongoing pandemic, we rely on death data that is incomplete, with systematic biases in reporting, and subject to future consolidation. We estimate that, for all the countries we consider, current interventions have been sufficient to drive the reproduction number $${R}_{t}$$Rt below 1 (probability $${R}_{t}\,$$Rt< 1.0 is 99.9%) and achieve epidemic control. We estimate that, across all 11 countries, between 12 and 15 million individuals have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 up to 4th May, representing between 3.2% and 4.0% of the population. Our results show that major non-pharmaceutical interventions and lockdown in particular have had a large effect on reducing transmission. Continued intervention should be considered to keep transmission of SARS-CoV-2 under control.},

  abstractnote = {The impact of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on Jupiter in July, 1994, was the largest, most energetic impact event on a planet ever witnessed. Because it broke up during a close encounter with Jupiter in 1992, it was bright enough to be discovered more than a year prior to impact, allowing the scientific community an unprecedented opportunity to assess the effects such an event would have. Many excellent observations were made from Earth-based telescopes, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Galileo spacecraft en route to Jupiter. In this paper, these observations are used in conjunction with computational simulations performed with the CTH shock-physics hydrocode to determine the sizes of the fifteen fragments that made discernible impact features on the planet. To do this, CTH was equipped with a radiative ablation model and a post-processing radiative ray-trace capability that enabled light-flux predictions (often called the impact flash) for the viewing geometries of Galileo and ground-based observers. The five events recorded by Galileo were calibrated to give fragment size estimates. Compared against ground-based and HST observations, these estimates were extended using a least-squares analysis to assess the impacts of the remaining ten fragments. Some of the largest impacts (L, G and K) were greater that 1 km in diameter but the density of the fragments was low, about 0.25 g/cm{sup 3}. The volume of the combined fifteen fragments would make a sphere 1.8 km in diameter. Assuming a pre-breakup density of 0.5 g/cm{sup 3}, the parent body of Shoemaker-Levy 9 had a probable diameter of 1.4 km. The total kinetic energy of all the impacts was equivalent to the explosive yield of 300 Gigatons of TNT.},

Arguments are adduced that ablation is of secondary importance in comparison with mechanical processes of deformation and fragmentation. 2D hydrodynamic simulations using the free-Lagrangian method and the Eulerian method with a volume-of-fluid front tracking procedure have been carried out. The cosmic body was treated as a fluid, with the equation of state of water, moving through gas of appropriate density. We find that disintegration is more complex than simple models based on the estimate of lateral expansion due to differential ram pressure across a meteoroid make it. Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities strongly deform the body and it breaks up in the center. The outer radius of an originally spherical or cylindrical body agrees with the analytic models of spreading. However, a body of accidentally aerodynamic shape does not have its cross section significantly enlarged. A sandbag model has been developed in which a heavily dispersed meteoroid is represented as a conglomeration of noncolliding particles moving through the atmosphere. The particles transfer energy and impulse to the atmosphere and are enclosed by a single bow shock. Calculations show that a spherical swarm of particles takes a conical form but lateral expansion agrees with the above-mentioned simple theoretical models. The approximate analytical approach of a spreading fragmented impactor has got additional support: integration of the drag, ablation, and radiation equations produces results which are in a good agreement with light flashes registered by DoD satellites.},

At zenith angle 0° and a typical impact: velocity at the top of the atmosphere of V = 17.5 km/s, the atmosphere absorbs more than half the kinetic energy of stony meteoroids with diameters, DM<230 m and iron meteoroids with DM<50 m. At zenith angle 45° the corresponding figures are 360 and 70 m while at 60° they are 500 and 100 m. For comets with V = 50 km/s the values are DM<1900 and 3000 m for 45 and 60°, respectively, using typical values of ablation, but they are much smaller if ablation is reduced. Only impactors with DM above these critical values are effective in producing ground impact damage: craters, earthquakes, and tsunami. Smaller impactors can still produce atmospheric blast waves. It is found that the area of destruction around the impact point in which the overpressure in the blast wave exceeds 4p.s.i. = 2.8  x 10^5 dyn/cm^2, which is enough to knock over trees and destroy buildings. It is found that for chondritic asteroids entering at zenith angle 45° and an impact velocity at the top of the atmosphere of 17.5 km/s that it increases rapidly from zero for those less than 50 m in diameter (13.5 megatons) to about 2000 km2 for those 76 m in diameter (31 megatons). If we assume that a stony asteroid 100 m in diameter hits land about every 1000 years, we find that a 50 m diameter one (causing some blast damage) hits land every 125 years while a Tunguska size impactor occurs about every 400 years. If iron asteroids are about 3.5 per cent of the frequency of stony ones of the same size, they constitute most of the impactors that produce areas of blast damage of less than 300 km2. While the optical flux from a small asteroid such as Tunguska is enough to ignite pine forests, the blast from it goes beyond the radius within which the fire starts. The blast tends to blow out the fire, so it is likely that the impact will char the forest (as at Tunguska), but it will not produce a sustained fire.},

Observation of bright fireballs in the Earth's atmosphere can explore meteoroid structure by studying meteoroid fragmentation during the flight. Earlier evaluations showed that the meteoroid's strength is significantly lower than that of the recovered meteorites. We present a detailed study of atmospheric fragmentation of seven meteorite falls, all ordinary chondrites, and 14 other fireballs, where meteorite fall was predicted but the meteorites, probably also ordinary chondrites, were not recovered. All observations were made by the autonomous observatories of the European Fireball Network and include detailed radiometric light curves. A model, called the semiempirical fragmentation model, was developed to fit the light curves and decelerations. Videos showing individual fragments were available in some cases. The results demonstrated that meteoroids do not fragment randomly but in two distinct phases. The first phase typically corresponds to low strengths of 0.04 - 0.12 MPa. In two-thirds of cases, the first phase was catastrophic or nearly catastrophic with at least 40% of mass lost. The second phase corresponds to 0.9 - 5 MPa for confirmed meteorite falls and somewhat lower strengths, from about 0.5 MPa, for smaller meteoroids. All of these strengths are lower than the tensile strengths of ordinary chondritic meteorites cited in the literature, 20 - 40 MPa. We interpret the second phase as being due to cracks in meteoroids and the first phase as a separation of weakly cemented fragments, which reaccumulated at the surfaces of asteroids after asteroid collisions.},

  abstract = {Abstract A new 1.5 meter diameter impact crater was discovered on Mars only ~40 km from the InSight lander. Context camera images constrained its formation between February 21 and April 6, 2019; follow-up HiRISE images resolved the crater. During this time period, three seismic events were identified in InSight data. We derive expected seismic signal characteristics and use them to evaluate each of the seismic events. However, none of them can definitively be associated with this source. Atmospheric perturbations are generally expected to be generated during impacts; however, in this case, no signal could be identified as related to the known impact. Using scaling relationships based on the terrestrial and lunar analogs and numerical modeling, we predict the amplitude, peak frequency, and duration of the seismic signal that would have emanated from this impact. The predicted amplitude falls near the lowest levels of the measured seismometer noise for the predicted frequency. Hence it is not surprising this impact event was not positively identified in the seismic data. Finding this crater was a lucky event as its formation this close to InSight has a probability of only ~0.2, and the odds of capturing it in before and after images is extremely low. We revisit impact-seismic discriminators in light of real experience with a seismometer on the martian surface. Using measured noise of the instrument, we revise our previous prediction of seismic impact detections downwards, from ~a few to tens, to just ~2 per Earth year, still with an order of magnitude uncertainty.},

The airburst of the Chelyabinsk meteoroid occurred due to its catastrophic fragmentation in the atmosphere. Simulations of the space-time distribution of energy deposition during the airburst were done using a novel fragmentation model based on dimensionality considerations and analogy to the fission chain reaction in fissile materials. To get an estimate of the airburst energy, observed values of the airwave arrival times to different populated localities were retrieved from video records available on the Internet. The calculated arrival times agree well with the observed values for all the localities. Energy deposition in the atmosphere obtained from observations of the airwave arrival times was found to be 460âÂ±â60 kt in trinitrotoluene (TNT) equivalent. We also obtained an independent estimate for the deposited energy, kt TNT from detecting the air increment velocity due to the wave passage in Chelyabinsk. Assuming that the energy of about 90 kt TNT was irradiated in the form of visible light and infrared radiation, as registered with optical sensors [Yeomans and Chodas, 2013], one can value the total energy release to be about 550 kt TNT which is in agreement with previous estimates from infrasound registration and from optical sensors data. The overpressure amplitude and its positive phase duration in the airwave that reached the city of Chelyabinsk were calculated to be about 2 kPa and 10âs accordingly.},

It is found that the area of destruction around the impact point in which the overpressure in the blast wave exceeds 4p.s.i. = 2.8  x 10^5 dyn/cm^2, which is enough to knock over trees and destroy buildings. It is found that for chondritic asteroids entering at zenith angle 45° and an impact velocity at the top of the atmosphere of 17.5 km/s that it increases rapidly from zero for those less than 50 m in diameter (13.5 megatons) to about 2000 km2 for those 76 m in diameter (31 megatons). If we assume that a stony asteroid 100 m in diameter hits land about every 1000 years, we find that a 50 m diameter one (causing some blast damage) hits land every 125 years while a Tunguska size impactor occurs about every 400 years. If iron asteroids are about 3.5 per cent of the frequency of stony ones of the same size, they constitute most of the impactors that produce areas of blast damage of less than 300 km2. While the optical flux from a small asteroid such as Tunguska is enough to ignite pine forests, the blast from it goes beyond the radius within which the fire starts. The blast tends to blow out the fire, so it is likely that the impact will char the forest (as at Tunguska), but it will not produce a sustained fire.},

  abstract  = {The internal structure and strength of small asteroids and large meteoroids is poorly known. Observation of bright fireballs in the Earth's atmosphere can explore meteoroid structure by studying meteoroid fragmentation during the flight. Earlier evaluations showed that the meteoroid's strength is significantly lower than that of the recovered meteorites. We present a detailed study of atmospheric fragmentation of seven meteorite falls, all ordinary chondrites, and 14 other fireballs, where meteorite fall was predicted but the meteorites, probably also ordinary chondrites, were not recovered. All observations were made by the autonomous observatories of the European Fireball Network and include detailed radiometric light curves. A model, called the semiempirical fragmentation model, was developed to fit the light curves and decelerations. Videos showing individual fragments were available in some cases. The results demonstrated that meteoroids do not fragment randomly but in two distinct phases. The first phase typically corresponds to low strengths of 0.04 - 0.12 MPa. In two-thirds of cases, the first phase was catastrophic or nearly catastrophic with at least 40% of mass lost. The second phase corresponds to 0.9 - 5 MPa for confirmed meteorite falls and somewhat lower strengths, from about 0.5 MPa, for smaller meteoroids. All of these strengths are lower than the tensile strengths of ordinary chondritic meteorites cited in the literature, 20 - 40 MPa. We interpret the second phase as being due to cracks in meteoroids and the first phase as a separation of weakly cemented fragments, which reaccumulated at the surfaces of asteroids after asteroid collisions.},

  abstract = {Asteroids tens to hundreds of meters in diameter constitute the most immediate impact hazard to human populations, yet the rate at which they arrive at Earth's surface is poorly known. Astronomic observations are still incomplete in this size range; impactors are subjected to disruption in Earth's atmosphere, and unlike the Moon, small craters on Earth are rapidly eroded. In this paper, we first model the atmospheric behavior of iron and stony bodies over the mass range 1 - 10^12 kg (size range 6 cm-1 km) taking into account deceleration, ablation, and fragmentation. Previous models in meteoritics deal with rather small masses (<10^5 - 10^6 kg) with the aim of interpreting registered fireballs in atmosphere, or with substantially larger objects without taking into account asteroid disruption to model cratering processes. A few earlier attempts to model terrestrial crater strewn fields did not take into account possible cascade fragmentation. We have performed large numbers of simulations in a wide mass range, using both the earlier ``pancake'' models and also the separated fragments model to develop a statistical picture of atmosphere-bolide interaction for both iron and stony impactors with initial diameters up to {\textasciitilde}1 km. Second, using a compilation of data for the flux at the upper atmosphere, we have derived a cumulative size-frequency distribution (SFD) for upper atmosphere impactors. This curve is a close fit to virtually all of the upper atmosphere data over 16 orders of magnitude. Third, we have applied our model results to scale the upper atmosphere curve to a flux at the Earth's surface, elucidating the impact rate of objects <1 km diameter on Earth. We find that iron meteorites >5 times 104 kg (2.5 m) arrive at the Earth's surface approximately once every 50 years. Iron bodies a few meters in diameter (10^5 - 10^6 kg), which form craters {\textasciitilde}100 m in diameter, will strike the Earth's land area every 500 years. Larger bodies will form craters 0.5 km in diameter every 20,000 years, and craters 1 km in diameter will be formed on the Earth's land area every 50,000 years. Tunguska events (low-level atmospheric disruption of stony bolides >108 kg) may occur every 500 years. Bodies capable of producing hazardous tsunami ({\textasciitilde}200 m diameter projectiles) should strike the Earth's surface every {\textasciitilde}100,000 years. This data also allows us to assess the completeness of the terrestrial crater record for a given area over a given time interval.},
