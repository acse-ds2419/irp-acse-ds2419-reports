  abstract = {Fragmentation of meter-sized impactors in the Martian atmosphere leads to the formation of crater clusters consisting of up to hundreds of craters spread over an area of up to kilometers across. Identification of 77 crater clusters on the Martian surface reveals that as the size of the cluster increases the range in the number of craters present increases. Furthermore, clus- ters with larger craters typically consist of a single or several large craters among numerous smaller craters, whereas clusters of smaller craters show a broad variation in the size-frequency distribution of craters. To further understanding of meteoroid fragmentation and the forma- tion of crater clusters on Mars, a meteoroid atmospheric entry model proposed by Wheeler et al. (2018), which assumes an initial meteoroid with a non-uniform structure was adapted and implemented in Python. A Monte Carlo simulation was performed using this new model to produce synthetic cluster data for comparison with observations on Mars. For comparison, the same Monte Carlo approach was performed using two previous atmospheric entry models, that assume the meteoroid has a uniform initial structure. The new model developed in this work is able to replicate the variation in size-frequency distribution of craters seen on Mars; whereas, the clusters produced by previous models do not display any variation in crater size-frequency distribution observed as the size of clusters increase. e results of this work indicate that the tra- ditional method of modelling meteoroid fragmentation, that produces a collection of fragments all of similar size, is not appropriate for fragmentation and crater cluster formation on Mars. Instead replicating crater cluster formation on Mars requires a steep size-frequency distribution of fragments with multiple small fragments and fewer large fragments.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the physics of meteoroid breakup in the atmosphere and its implications for the observed features of strewn fields. There are several effects which cause dispersion of the meteoroid fragments: gravity, differential lift of the fragments, bow shock interaction just after breakup, centripetal separation by a rotating meteoroid, and possibly a dynamical transverse separation resulting from the crushing deceleration in the atmosphere. Of these, we show that gravity alone can produce the common pattern in which the largest crater occurs at the downrange end of the scatter ellipse. The average lift-to-drag ratio of the tumbling fragments must be less than about 10−3, otherwise small fragments would produce small craters downrange of the main crater, and this is not generally observed. The cross-range dispersion is probably due to the combined effects of bow shock interaction, crushing deceleration, and possibly spinning of the meteoroid. A number of terrestrial strewn fields are discussed in the light of these ideas, which are formulated quantitatively for a range of meteoroid velocities, entry angles, and crushing strengths. It is found that when the crater size exceeds about 1 km, the separation between the fragments upon landing is a fraction of their own diameter, so that the crater formed by such a fragmented meteoroid is almost indistinguishable from that formed by a solid body of the same total mass and velocity.},

  abstract = {Abstract Asteroids and comets 10–100 m in size that collide with Earth disrupt dramatically in the atmosphere with an explosive transfer of energy, caused by extreme air drag. Such airbursts produce a strong blastwave that radiates from the meteoroid's trajectory and can cause damage on the surface. An established technique for predicting airburst blastwave damage is to treat the airburst as a static source of energy and to extrapolate empirical results of nuclear explosion tests using an energy-based scaling approach. Here we compare this approach to two more complex models using the iSALE shock physics code. We consider a moving-source airburst model where the meteoroid's energy is partitioned as two-thirds internal energy and one-third kinetic energy at the burst altitude, and a model in which energy is deposited into the atmosphere along the meteoroid's trajectory based on the pancake model of meteoroid disruption. To justify use of the pancake model, we show that it provides a good fit to the inferred energy release of the 2013 Chelyabinsk fireball. Predicted overpressures from all three models are broadly consistent at radial distances from ground zero that exceed three times the burst height. At smaller radial distances, the moving-source model predicts overpressures two times greater than the static-source model, whereas the cylindrical line-source model based on the pancake model predicts overpressures two times lower than the static-source model. Given other uncertainties associated with airblast damage predictions, the static-source approach provides an adequate approximation of the azimuthally averaged airblast for probabilistic hazard assessment.},

  abstract = {Abstract— We investigate the action of the martian atmosphere on entering meteoroids for present and past atmospheres with various surface pressures to predict the smallest observable craters, and to understand the implications for the size distributions of craters on Mars and meteoroids in space. We assume different strengths appropriate to icy, stone, and iron bodies and test the results against available data on terrestrial bolides. Deceleration, ablation, and fragmentation effects are included. We find that the smallest icy, stone, and iron meteoroids to hit the martian ground at crater forming speeds of ≥500 m/s have diameters of about 2 m, 0.03-0.9 m (depending on strength), and 0.01 m, respectively, in the current atmosphere. For hypothetical denser past atmospheres, the cutoff diameters rise. At a surface pressure of 100 mb, the cutoff diameters are about 24 m, 5–12 m, and 0.14 m for the 3 classes. The weaker stony bodies in the size range of about 1–30 m may explode at altitudes of about 10–20 km above the ground. These figures imply that under the present atmosphere, the smallest craters made by these objects would be as follows: by ice bodies, craters of diameter (D) ˜8 m, by stones about 0.5–6 m, and by irons, about 0.3 m. A strong depletion of craters should, thus, occur at diameters below about 0.3 m to 5 m. Predicted fragmentation and ablation effects on weak meteoroids in the present atmosphere may also produce a milder depletion below D ˜500 m, relative to the lunar population. But, this effect may be difficult to detect in present data because of additional losses of small craters due to sedimentation, dunes, and other obliteration effects. Craters in strewn fields, caused by meteoroid fragmentation, will be near or below present-day resolution limits, but examples have been found. These phenomena have significant consequences. Under the present atmosphere, the smallest (decimeter-scale) craters in sands and soils could be quickly obliterated but might still be preserved on rock surfaces, as noted by Hörz et al. (1999). Ancient crater populations, if preserved, could yield diagnostic signatures of earlier atmospheric conditions. Surfaces formed under past denser atmospheres (few hundred mbar), if preserved by burial and later exposed by exhumation, could show: a) striking depletions of small craters (few meter sizes up to as much as 200 m), relative to modern surfaces; b) more clustered craters due to atmospheric breakup; and c) different distributions of meteorite types, with 4 m to 200 m craters formed primarily by irons instead of by stones as on present-day Mars. Megaregolith gardening of the early crust would be significant but coarser than the gardening of the ancient lunar uplands.},

The motion of these fragments cannot be described in the frame of liquid-like models. The primary purpose of this study is to achieve some success in improving the alternative model of separate fragments, which is based on studying the motion of a finite number of fragments interacting with each other through the air pressure. The three-dimensional (3-D) numerical technique is elaborated for the direct modeling of the flow around several arbitrarily arranged fragments. The model allows us to calculate the ablation mass rate and aerodynamic loading for each fragment. The new approach (hybrid model) based on the simultaneous solution of the 3-D hydrodynamic equations for the airflow and the differential equations for the motion of discrete particles is proposed to study the debris cloud evolution, taking into account successive fragmentation. The simplified version of this model was applied to the Sikhote-Alin meteorite shower, Benešov bolide, and small meteoroids' impacts against the Martian surface.},

We report these statistics for 77 clusters: number of craters, size of cluster, dispersion of cluster, direction (azimuth) from which the impactor approached, and an estimate of the angle from vertical of the impact. Clusters range from a few to hundreds of craters, with most containing tens of craters. They are most commonly dispersed over hundreds of meters, with extents ranging from a few meters to a few kilometers. We find that dispersion generally does not correlate with topographic elevation. However, when the highest elevations are disregarded, clusters are more dispersed at lower elevations, as expected. Impact azimuths are randomly distributed and do not express a clear directionality of incoming meteoroids. Results suggest impacts occur closer to horizontal than expected, which could be due to observational effects. The characteristics we report here provide important constraints for future work in understanding atmospheric fragmentation processes; properties of the impactors themselves, such as density and orbital parameters; and the seismic detectability of impacts. These are critical aspects to understand, as approximately half of current impacts are observed to be clusters.},

Analytic models of asteroid breakup and energy deposition processes are needed in order to assess potential airburst hazards, and to enable inferences about asteroid properties or breakup physics to be made from comparisons with observed meteors. This paper presents a fragment-cloud model (FCM) that is able to represent a broad range of breakup behaviors and the resulting variations in energy deposition in ways that make it a useful tool for both applications. Sensitivity studies are performed to investigate how variations the model's fragmentation parameters affect the energy deposition results for asteroids 20–500m in diameter. The model is also used to match observational data from the Chelyabinsk meteor and infer potential asteroid properties and representative modeling parameter ranges. Results illustrate how the model's fragmentation parameters can introduce different energy deposition features, and how much they affect the overall energy deposition rates, magnitudes, and altitudes that would drive ground damage for risk assessment applications.},

  abstract = {Asteroids populations are highly diverse, ranging from coherent monoliths to loosely bound rubble piles, with a broad range of material and compositional properties. These different structures and properties could significantly affect how an asteroid breaks up and deposits energy in the atmosphere, and how much ground damage may occur from resulting blast waves. We have previously developed a fragment-cloud model (FCM) for assessing the atmospheric breakup and energy deposition of asteroids striking Earth. The approach represents ranges of breakup characteristics by combining progressive fragmentation with releases of variable fractions of debris and larger discrete fragments. In this work, we have extended the FCM to also represent asteroids with varied initial structures, such as rubble piles or fractured bodies. We have used the extended FCM to model the Chelyabinsk, Benešov, Košice, and Tagish Lake meteors, and have obtained excellent matches to energy deposition profiles derived from their light curves. These matches provide validation for the FCM approach, help guide further model refinements, and enable inferences about pre-entry structure and breakup behavior. Results highlight differences in the amount of small debris vs. discrete fragments in matching the various flare characteristics of each meteor. The Chelyabinsk flares were best represented using relatively high debris fractions, while Košice and Benešov cases were more notably driven by their discrete fragmentation characteristics, perhaps indicating more cohesive initial structures. Tagish Lake exhibited a combination of these characteristics, with lower-debris fragmentation at high altitudes followed by sudden disintegration into small debris in the lower flares. Results from all cases also suggest that lower ablation coefficients and debris spread rates may be more appropriate for the way in which debris clouds are represented in FCM, offering an avenue for future model refinement.},

  abstract = {As evidenced by the Chelyabinsk and Tunguska airburst events in Russia, decameter-scale Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) can pose a hazard to human life and infrastructure from the energy they deposit in the atmosphere as they break up. To understand the potential damage these small NEOs can cause on Earth's surface, it is imperative to be able to model their atmospheric entry quickly and accurately. Here we compare three semi-analytical models of asteroid airbursts that differ in their descriptions of fragment separation and spreading. Each model can be calibrated to produce a good fit to the energy deposition curve inferred from Chelyabinsk observations, but in each case the implied initial meteoroid strength is different and when the calibrated models are upscaled to Tunguska, the results diverge. This introduces an inter-model uncertainty that compounds the large range of uncertain physical and model parameters that influence probabilistic hazard assessment. Uncertainty quantification of airburst energy deposition was performed for a theoretical impacting object with H-magnitude 27, assuming no prior knowledge of any other impactor or model parameter. Each of the three models produces a different distribution of airburst outcomes, however, the variation attributable to physical parameter uncertainty is far larger than the inter-model differences. To constrain the initial conditions of the Tunguska event, the same uncertainty quantification was performed for an H-magnitude 24 event. Among the scenarios consistent with Tunguska observations (5–10 km burst altitude, 10–60° trajectory angle, 3–50 MT TNT total energy release) the most likely range of impact conditions was: radius of 25–75 m, mass of 1× 108– 2.5× 109 kg, initial velocity of 11.5–33 km/s, and angle of 25–60°.},

We have also utilized the differential panchromatic luminous efficiency of ReVelle and Ceplecha (2002) to compute bolide luminosity. In addition we also introduce the concept of the differential and integral acoustic/infrasonic efficiency and generalized it to the case of mechanical wave efficiency including internal atmospheric gravity waves generated during entry. Unlike the other efficiencies which are assumed to be a constant multiple of the luminous efficiency, the acoustic efficiency is calculated independently using a ``first principles'' approach. All of these topics have been pursued using either a homogeneous or a porous meteoroid model with great success. As a direct result, porosity seems to be a rather good possibility for explaining anomalous meteoroid behavior in the atmosphere.},

Analytic models of asteroid entry and breakup physics are used to compute the energy deposition, which can then be compared against measured light curves and used to estimate ground damage due to airburst events. This work assesses and compares energy deposition results from four existing approaches to asteroid breakup modeling, and presents a new model that combines key elements of those approaches. The existing approaches considered include a liquid drop or âpancakeâ model where the object is treated as a single deforming body, and a set of discrete fragment models where the object breaks progressively into individual fragments. The new model incorporates both independent fragments and aggregate debris clouds to represent a broader range of fragmentation behaviors and reproduce more detailed light curve features. All five models are used to estimate the energy deposition rate versus altitude for the Chelyabinsk meteor impact, and results are compared with an observationally derived energy deposition curve. Comparisons show that four of the five approaches are able to match the overall observed energy deposition profile, but the features of the combined model are needed to better replicate both the primary and secondary peaks of the Chelyabinsk curve.},

  abstract = {Following the emergence of a novel coronavirus1 (SARS-CoV-2) and its spread outside of China, Europe has experienced large epidemics. In response, many European countries have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions such as closure of schools and national lockdowns. We study the impact of major interventions across 11 European countries for the period from the start of COVID-19 until the 4th of May 2020 when lockdowns started to be lifted. Our model calculates backwards from observed deaths to estimate transmission that occurred several weeks prior, allowing for the time lag between infection and death. We use partial pooling of information between countries with both individual and shared effects on the reproduction number. Pooling allows more information to be used, helps overcome data idiosyncrasies, and enables more timely estimates. Our model relies on fixed estimates of some epidemiological parameters such as the infection fatality rate, does not include importation or subnational variation and assumes that changes in the reproduction number are an immediate response to interventions rather than gradual changes in behavior. Amidst the ongoing pandemic, we rely on death data that is incomplete, with systematic biases in reporting, and subject to future consolidation. We estimate that, for all the countries we consider, current interventions have been sufficient to drive the reproduction number $${R}_{t}$$Rt below 1 (probability $${R}_{t}\,$$Rt< 1.0 is 99.9%) and achieve epidemic control. We estimate that, across all 11 countries, between 12 and 15 million individuals have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 up to 4th May, representing between 3.2% and 4.0% of the population. Our results show that major non-pharmaceutical interventions and lockdown in particular have had a large effect on reducing transmission. Continued intervention should be considered to keep transmission of SARS-CoV-2 under control.},

Shock wave configurations, aerodynamical forces and moments acting on each fragment and the trajectories of the pieces are determined for hypothetical initial configurations. The results of numerical simulations show that a meteoroid's breakup may lead to both increase and decrease of the total cross section, drag forces and energy release in the atmosphere. As a consequence the emitted radiation varies.},

Point-source solutions that are known to exist are discussed. The implications to scaling are developed.
